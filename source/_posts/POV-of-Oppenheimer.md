# Oppenheimer (film)
After watching the Oppenheimer, I can’t tell that what I am feeling. First of all, it must be clear that the conversation I will talk is not about any country, any government, any things in reality. What I will talk is just about the film. 
&ensp;&ensp; Yes, the film is extremely good. The sound, the actors, the music. I found that some Oppenheimer’s personality is just the same as mine. We both pursue the high end technology, think about how to change the world. I don’t deny that I like the learning atmosphere abroad. But I can feel the responsibility on his shoulder is becoming heavier. Yes, succeed in technical field, too successful to explosion. Because of it, so many people died. They have the right to invent it, but no right to decide whether use it or not. There is no true or false. Just one way they have is just going down. Not everyone want to know the truth, but there’s someone known the truth. It’s completely the hell. Oppenheimer is smart, he really want to take all the responsibilities on his own. It’s unfair, but understandable. 
&ensp;&ensp; However, we go to a movie for the art, not for solving the problem that even Oppenheimer can’t solve. Few things can be more exciting than build a town and some bombs by spending 2 billion dollars. At the end, let me criticism subtitle group. The translation is so bad that I even wonder if you just use the tools to translate instead of their stupid brain. ( Forgive my rudeness! ) 
&ensp;&ensp; PS: Cillian Murphy, I like him so much. I began to know him by watching the Peaky Blinders. Perfect actors!
